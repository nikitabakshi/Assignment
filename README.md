I have used Java language for coding .
Used below libraries and added in pom.xml file :
1) jsoup library  \which is a Java HTML Parser library used for scraping and paringe HTML from a URL, file, or string
2) OpenCSV library which is a CSV parser library for Java for performing operations on the CSV file.

Also , added the TestAssignment.java class which contains the main code and links.csv as a output file
